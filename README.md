1 .........given/ input  number (n) using simple mathamatical operator "**" , which is used for squaring the number
2.......... using % operator because it gives reminder as output and if reminder is not == 0 then it is not leap year   x ==  year%4 gives reminder .. and y == year%100 is used to eliminate non leap year according to gregorian calander
